[The 7 Most Important Computer Science Trends in 2021](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/computer-science-trends)

This is an interesting article to me becauce it highlights a few interesting trends in computer science. For one we have the trend that everyone knows about, Quantum Computing, I feel like that's basically been a buzz word for awhile now and it probably will continue to be one but it's nice to see some progress being made on it even though I won't even pretend to truly understand how it works.

Another interesting thing addressed in the article is this programming language called kotlin. Apparently, this is gaining steam and it'll become a more mainstream programming language, but, who knows, could just be another programming language that everyone hypes up and nothing ever happens.

Instead, they mention that vertification methods limiting access to internal users is also important, as a manevolent user who manages to enter the system needs to face more obstacles and be prevented fom causing maximal damage.
