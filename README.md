[The 7 Most Important Computer Science Trends in 2021](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/computer-science-trends)

This is an interesting article to me becauce it highlights a few interesting trends in computer science. For one we have the trend that everyone knows about, Quantum Computing, I feel like that's basically been a buzz word for awhile now and it probably will continue to be one but it's nice to see some progress being made on it even though I won't even pretend to truly understand how it works.

Another interesting thing addressed in the article is this programming language called kotlin. Apparently, this is gaining steam and it'll become a more mainstream programming language, but, who knows, could just be another programming language that everyone hypes up and nothing ever happens.

I also found many of these trends interesting. There were a few that I've heard of such as quantum computing, which shows some level of consistency in its growth. There were a few however that I had never heard of, such as kotlin, and it was exciting to learn about these. Perhaps I should do more research, especially into kotlin as a Java developer.
